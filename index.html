        <h2 id='location'>Where are you from?</h2>
        <p>I am from the East Coast, Massachusetts specifically, Boston even more specifically. 
            Before moving here, I lived in Denver for a year. I miss some East Coast things but 
            overall am loving West Coast life.</p>

        <h2 id='pets'>Do you have pets?</h2>
        <p>Yes! I have a cat named, Max. I got him in New Hampshire in 2016 and he's been the 
            best thing ever. He's 8 years old. He loves cuddles and snoozing and making biscuits.</p>
